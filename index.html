                                Built during my time at Stanley Park Digital, Verified.Bio was a greenfield project web app providing a
                                connection between recruiters and their candidates' references, allowing recruiters to
                                get the right person for the job. Built using Python with the Django framework,
                                Foundation for the HTML/CSS framework, and includes some notable features such as SMS
                                integration and PDF generation (which was a challenge that felt great to overcome).

                                In conjunction with the Lambton Water Center and Lambton College, much of my time as a
                                research student was spent working on this residential-sized water purification system.
                                The usual control system is eschewed for a combination Raspberry Pi and Arduino combo
                                running the REX Controls automation system, a pseudo-programming control system reading
                                data from the various sensors watching water purity and flow. My main achievement with
                                this project is implementing a web-based interface accessible from anywhere, useful for
                                turning on the cottage water while on the road.
