                                Built during my time at Stanley Park Digital, Verified.Bio was a greenfield project web app providing a
                                connection between recruiters and their candidates' references, allowing recruiters to
                                get the right person for the job. Built using Python with the Django framework,
                                Foundation for the HTML/CSS framework, and includes some notable features such as SMS
                                integration and PDF generation (which was a challenge that felt great to overcome).
