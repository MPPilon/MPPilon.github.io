                                Built during my time at Stanley Park Digital, Verified.Bio was a greenfield project web app providing a
                                connection between recruiters and their candidates' references, allowing recruiters to
                                get the right person for the job. Built using Python with the Django framework,
                                Foundation for the HTML/CSS framework, and includes some notable features such as SMS
                                integration and PDF generation (which was a challenge that felt great to overcome).

                                In conjunction with the Lambton Water Center and Lambton College, much of my time as a
                                research student was spent working on this residential-sized water purification system.
                                The usual control system is eschewed for a combination Raspberry Pi and Arduino combo
                                running the REX Controls automation system, a pseudo-programming control system reading
                                data from the various sensors watching water purity and flow. My main achievements with
                                this project are reverse-engineering the project as-is with minimal documentation, and
                                implementing a web-based interface accessible from anywhere, useful for turning on the
                                cottage water while on the road.

                                My first assignment as a research student at Lambton College. A local company,
                                Industrial Web Apps, was seeking a partnership with the college to produce a method
                                where they could retrieve various information from multiple points remotely; the most
                                prominent example being data from sewers around town. My task was to utilize the
                                Raspberry Pi and various sensors/circuitry in order to collect and transmit this data to
                                a centralized web app that could collect and display it. Before moving to another
                                project, I managed to construct a simple temperature sensor that was transmitting its
                                readings to the web app via the OPC-UA protocol implemented in Node.js.
